Esquire published an article saying that the Visayans of the Philippines raided China in the 12th century. They cited Henry Scott's work that connected the Pishayen raids from Taiwan with the Visayans of Maharlika.  

<!-- In 1171, "cannibalistic" Pishayen raiders from the Penghu Islands near Taiwan attacked the Fujian coast in China in search of iron and other goods to plunder. They were described by Chau Ju-Kua as primitive savages similar to beasts. According to Hirth, the sinologists Lacouperie and Laufer wrongly associated the Pishayens with the Visayans because of phonetic coincidence. Scott makes the same mistake but bases his association on Alcina's record of a Visayan Bohol raid on China that happened 500 years later in the 17th century. -->
