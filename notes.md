Maharlikanism includes the bayanihan economy which is based on barter instead of money. This made Maharlika resilient, yet free from invaders who were after gold (e.g. Kublai Khan invaded Java, which used money, but not Maharlika). This also reduced inequality and made inflation and financial crisis obsolete.

Earlier writers, including Jose Rizal and Ferdinand Blumentritt,[27] accepted the "buddhist connection" more readily. For example, in supporting Blumentritt's proposition that Ma-i was somewhere on Luzon Island, Rizal cites the Zhu Fan Zhi's use of the word "Buddhas" as evidence:
"The gentleness of Tagalog customs that the first Spaniards found, very different from those of other provinces of the same race and in Luzon itself, can very well be the effect of Buddhism."(There are copper Buddha's images)."[27]

Medicine 
Pigafetta was the first European to write about the Philippines. He tells of a diseased Cebuano who was supposed to die because native medicine could not cure him. The Spanish friars visited the man and gave him Western medicine and was cured within a few days. This led to the conversion of Cebu to Christianity. This is similar to China giving vaccines for free to the Philippines and other countries which convinced those countries to pledge allegiance to China.
